# Quote Generator React App

This is a simple React application that generates random quotes from a curated list.

## Features

- Random Quotes: Fetches quotes from a predefined list and displays a random quote each time the user clicks the "New Quote" button.
- Dynamic Color Scheme: The application dynamically changes its color palette with each new quote, providing a visually engaging experience.
- Social Media Sharing: Users can easily share their favorite quotes on Twitter and Tumblr using the provided social media buttons.

The quotes are sourced from this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/camperbot/5a022b72e96c4c9585c32bf6a75f62d9/raw/e3c6895ce42069f0ee7e991229064f167fe8ccdc/quotes.json).
